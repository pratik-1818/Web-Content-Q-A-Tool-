# Web Content Q&A Tool Documentation

## Overview

The **Web Content Q&A Tool** is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to extract content from a webpage, process it using vector search with FAISS, and answer user questions by leveraging Groq's language model. The tool utilizes web scraping, text embedding, vector search, and LLM querying to provide relevant answers based on extracted web content.

## Features

- Extract text content from a given URL.
- Process the extracted text into smaller, meaningful chunks.
- Store and retrieve relevant chunks using FAISS vector search.
- Query the extracted content using Groq's LLM.
- Display answers in a user-friendly Streamlit interface.

## Skills

To effectively work with this tool, the following skills are recommended:

- **Python Programming**: Proficiency in writing and understanding Python scripts.
- **Web Scraping**: Knowledge of web scraping techniques using BeautifulSoup or Selenium.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Familiarity with text processing and embedding models.
- **Machine Learning**: Understanding of vector search using FAISS.
- **API Integration**: Ability to work with Groq API and other third-party APIs.
- **Streamlit Development**: Experience in building interactive web applications using Streamlit.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following dependencies are installed before running the script:

```sh
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 streamlit langchain faiss-cpu sentence-transformers
```

## How to Run the Application

1. Save the script as `app.py`.
2. Run the following command:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
3. Enter a **URL** and a **question**, then click **Get Answer**.

## Limitations

- The tool may not work well on websites with JavaScript-rendered content.
- Responses depend on the accuracy of the extracted text.
- The Groq API key must be valid to function properly.

## Future Enhancements

- Improve text extraction using Selenium for dynamic pages.
- Optimize FAISS search with better chunking strategies.
- Add caching to reduce redundant API calls.

## Conclusion

This **Web Content Q&A Tool** provides an easy way to extract and query information from web pages using LLMs and FAISS-based vector retrieval. By integrating **Streamlit**, it offers an interactive experience for users to get answers from any webpage efficiently.
